ðŸŒ€ Inverted Cart-Pendulum Simulation (Simulink)
ðŸ“‹ How to Run
Open MATLAB and launch Simulink.

Open the project file:
Navigate to the folder where you saved the .slx file and open it.

Once the model is open, double-click the "Scope" block to prepare it for visualization.

Click the Run button to start the simulation.

The results â€” including the cart position and pendulum angle â€” will be displayed in the Scope window.

âœ… Notes
Make sure all required parameters (e.g., M, m, l, g) are set in the MATLAB workspace if the model depends on them.
